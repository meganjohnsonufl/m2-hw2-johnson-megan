<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/x8dwffxq/Meg-5.jpg" alt=Self Portrait>
<p>Hi! My name is Megan and this is my little slice of the Internet. I am a current graduate student at the University of Florida working towards my Master's of Arts in Mass Communications with a concentration in Web Design. I completed my undergrad in 2015 through Robert Morris University, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Media Arts with a concentration in Graphic Design and a minor in Photography. I am from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and still reside there today. I'm truly a Steel City Yinzer as they say. Here's some little bits and pieces about me.</p>
<h2>Career Goals</h2>
<p>My career goals are pretty broad and to an extent very open ended. I have a huge desire to become either an Art/Creative Director or a  UX Designer. I'd love to make my photography business really flourish and become much bigger than what it is right now. Specializing in dog sports has been a great niche for me and I'd love to do more with that as well.</p>

    <li>Horseback Riding</li>
    <li>Paddleboarding (my favorite paddleboard is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/186144330514?chn=ps&mkevt=1&mkcid=28">this one</a>)</li>
